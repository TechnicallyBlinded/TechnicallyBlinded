Hi, My name is Aaron and I'm interested in making the digital and physical worlds we live in more inclusive to everyone. Be honest with yourself we all need help of some kind. There are those who are disabled due to software choices (whether in code, UX, or practices that are gotten rid of for visual astedics.) My goal is to make software accessible for every individual regardless of ability. I'm blind and have seen what hindering software looks like. I'm on a mission to help teach why accessibility is important to all. Come along with me on my journey as I continously learn and develop my programming skillset. 

When I'm either not learning code or teaching digital accessibility and helping clients improve their digital assets for true inclusion. I'm either reading sci-fi or fantasy books, dabbling into AI and LLM's, or working on music. 

I'm unique as I have a wide variety of musical tastes and play various instruments. I'll give you the shortlist of instruments I play on a regular basis. 
Guitar, bass, mandolin, keyboards, banjo, piano and sing. I hold a B.S. in Music with a concentration in Audio Production and a minor in Communications from Indiana University Southeast. 
My goals for programming are to learn both front end and back end development to be a fullstack engineer.
